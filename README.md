Case Study: Coffee Shop Sales Analysis

Overview

This case study analyzes the sales performance of a coffee shop using transactional data. The goal is to identify trends, patterns, and areas of improvement based on revenue, transactions, and product performance.

Data Analysis

The analysis was conducted using PivotTables in Excel, focusing on the following key aspects:

Revenue by Month

A PivotTable was created on a new tab to visualize revenue trends over different months.

This helps in understanding seasonal variations and overall sales growth.

Transactions by Day of the Week & Hour of the Day

Two PivotTables were added to analyze the number of transactions:

By day of the week, showing which days experience the highest and lowest sales.

By hour of the day, identifying peak and off-peak hours for better staffing and inventory planning.

Transactions by Product Category

A PivotTable was used to display the number of transactions per product category, sorted in descending order.

This highlights the most and least popular product categories.

Top 15 Products by Transactions & Revenue

A PivotTable was created to show the top 15 products based on transactions and revenue.

This provides insights into the best-selling items and their contribution to overall revenue.

Insights & Key Findings

Revenue Growth Trend: The monthly revenue chart shows consistent growth, indicating increasing customer engagement and sales volume.

Peak Sales Days: Sales peak on Fridays and Mondays, suggesting high customer visits at the beginning and end of the workweek.

Busy Hours: The highest number of transactions occur in the morning (6 AM - 10 AM), which aligns with morning coffee demand.

Best-Selling Products:

Brewed Chai Tea, Gourmet Brewed Coffee, and Barista Espresso are the top three products in terms of both transactions and revenue.

Hot Chocolate and Brewed Black Tea also contribute significantly to sales.

Low-Performing Products: Items like Packaged Chocolate and Branded Merchandise have minimal transactions, suggesting they may need promotional strategies or reconsideration.

Recommendations

Marketing Strategy:

Offer discounts or combo deals on slow-selling items to increase sales.

Promote best-selling items further through social media or loyalty programs.

Operational Efficiency:

Increase staffing during peak hours (morning shifts) to enhance customer service.

Optimize stock management to ensure availability of top-selling products.

New Product Introductions:

Introduce variations of best-sellers (e.g., flavored espresso or seasonal drinks) to attract more customers.

Conduct customer surveys to understand preferences for low-performing items.

Conclusion

The data-driven insights from this analysis provide a clear understanding of sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. By implementing targeted marketing, optimizing operations, and leveraging top-selling products, the coffee shop can maximize revenue and improve overall business efficiency.
